### Clone `angular-seed`

Clone the `angular-seed` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/Muthukumars1994/angular-seed.git
cd angular-seed
```
### Install Dependencies

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```


* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
`angular-seed` changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file. Putting it in the `app` folder
makes it easier to serve the files by a web server.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].
